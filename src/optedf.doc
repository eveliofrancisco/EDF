c----OPTEDF--OPTEDF--OPTEDF--OPTEDF--OPTEDF--OPTEDF--OPTEDF----------
c
c-----Driver routine of the optimization process used to approximate 
c     EDF as a direct product of (2c,2ne) chemical bond EDFs.
c
c     Within the input file of the 'edf' program the following keywords
c     can be given that are exclusively relevant of this routine:
c
c        1) ENDBONDING
c        2) TYPE
c        3) TYPE3C
c        4) PAIR
c        5) TRIO
c        6) EPSBOND
c        7) INICVAR
c        8) PRIN
c
c     The meaning of all of these orders is explained below.
c
c     1) 'ENDBONDING'
c
c     Sintax: ENDBONDING
c
c     Meaing: This order means that all the input that the routine 
c     'optedf' needs to work has been given, so that the calculation 
c     can start.
c
c     2) 'TYPE'
c
c     Sintax: TYPE type qq(type) ifixq(type) ffty(type) ifixf(type)
c
c     Meaning: This order defines a type of (2c,2e) bond. The maximum
c     value of 'type' is MAXBOND, a parameter whose current value is
c     maxbond=18. To increase the maximum possible number of types of
c     (2c,2e) bonds just increase the MVAR, MVARH, and MAXBOND values 
c     in the sentence 'parameter (mvar=36,mvarh=mvar/2,maxbond=18)' 
c     below and recompile.
c
c     'qq(type)' is 'the charge value of the bond', which is a measure
c     of the polarity of the bond. Its value is optimized in case that
c      the read in value of 'ifixq(type)' is non zero. Otherwise, the
c     value of 'qq(type)' is fixed. 
c
c     'ffty(type)' if the 'correlation factor of the bond'. Its value 
c     is optimized in case that the read in value of 'ifixf(type)' is
c     non zero. Otherwise, the value of 'ffty(type)' is fixed.
c
c     NO default values exist for 'qq(type)' and 'ffty(type)' and the
c     five values after the 'TYPE' keyword are mandatory. Tipical input
c     values for 'qq(type)' and 'ffty(type)' are 0.5 and 0.0,
c     respectively.
c
c     3) 'TYPE3C'
c
c     Sintax: TYPE3C type p200 p020 p002 p110 p101 f200 f020 f002 f110 f101
c
c     Meaning: This order defines a type of (3c,2e) bond. The maximum
c     value of 'type' is MAXBOND3C, a parameter whose current value is
c     maxbond3c=6. To increase the maximum possible number of types of
c     (3c,2e) bonds just increase the MAXBOND3C and MVAR3C values in the 
c     sentence 'parameter (mvar3c=30,maxbond3c=6)' below and recompile. 
c
c     'p200 p020 p002' are the input values for the probability that 
c     both electrons of the 3c bond are located in the first center (p200),
c     in the second center (p020), or in the third center (p002).
c
c     'p110' is the input value for the probability that one of
c     the electrons of the 3c bond is located in the first center and 
c     the second electron in the second center.
c
c     'p101' is the input value for the probability that one of
c     the electrons of the 3c bond is located in the first center and 
c     the second electron in the third center.
c
c     'f200 f020 f002 f110 f101' are five integer numbers that determine
c     if 'p200 p020 p002 p110 p101' are fixed or optimizable parameters.
c     For instance, f200=1 or 0 means that 'p200' is fixed or optimizable
c     respectively.
c
c      4) 'PAIR'
c
c      Sintax: PAIR fragment1 fragment2 type [ rtype ]
c
c      Meaning: This order indicates that a (2c,2e) bond of type 'type'
c      purportedly exists between the groups of atoms 'fragment1' and 
c      'fragment2'. 

c      'rtype' indicates the resonance structure used. The default is
c      rtype=1. It is recommended at this moment NOT TO ENTER THE
c      rtype VALUE IN THIS ORDER.
c
c     5) 'TRIO'
c
c     Sintax: TRIO fragment1 fragment2 fragment3 type [ rtype ]
c
c     Meaing: This order indicates that a (3c,2e) bond of type 'type'
c     purportedly exists between the groups of atoms 'fragment1',
c     'fragment2', and 'fragment3'.

c     'rtype' indicates the resonance structure used. The default is
c     rtype=1. It is recommended at this moment NOT TO ENTER THE
c     rtype VALUE IN THIS ORDER.
c
c     6) 'EPSBOND'
c
c     Sintax: EPSBOND epsbond
c
c     Convergence threshold in the EDF fitting. This order is not nece-
c     ssary, since a default value for 'epsbond' exists [10^(-4)].
c     
c
c     7) 'INICVAR'
c
c     Sintax: INICVAR h0
c
c     Meaning: 'h0' is a parameter used in the EDF fitting. Not necessary 
c     since a default value exists (0.1).
c
c     8) PRIN prin
c
c     Sintax: PRIN prin
c
c     Meaning: 'prin' is a printing level in the EDF fitting. Not necessary
c     since a default value exists (0).
